        To make a picture appear in our website, we need to use the (src) tag and include a source.<br>
        for the purpose of this tutorial i downloaded a picture and a gif, but you can use URL's too.

    <h3>If you have looked at the dog for more or less than 3 seconds<br>
    then please look at this dog.</h3>
