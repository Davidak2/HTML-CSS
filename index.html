    <h1>Welcome To My Portfolio!</h1>
    <p>This is the start of my own portfolio.
    this page will slowly be updated as i learn more about CSS and HTML. I will also post pictures and maybe even videos of my work
    as i learn by myself to make video games</p>
    <hr>
    <pre>
        what i wrote above is used the (p) tag.

        This paragraph is written using (pre) tag, which renders line breaks
        Next, i'm typing a comment in HTML. writting a comment is by using these tags:
        (!-- This is a comment --)

        <!-- Here is a comment -->

        *Note, every tag needs to have <> or <> with a / in it, not () or (/).

        This is a new lesson. Here we will have a Hyperling that 
        leads us to a new website when we click it.

        <a href="https://www.google.com/">
            <br><br>CLICK ME!
        </a>
        <p>
            Clicking the link will lead us to Google, but it will replace this page.<br>
            If we add Target="_Blank" inside the (a) tag, it will open Google in a new tab, <br>
            meaning we can keep this page open.

            <a href="https://www.google.com/"
            target="_blank">
                <br><br>CLICK ME FOR A NEW TAB!
            </a>

            <br>
            <br>
            The first two links are called absolute link, meaning they take us to a normal website.
            <br>
            We can also use the (a) tag to take us to different pages that WE made.
            <br>
            <br>
            <a href="NewSite.html">
            THIS IS CALLED A RELATIVE URL!
            </a>

            <br>
            <br>
            We can also add a "title" to the (a) tag,
            <br> which opens a small infobox when we hover over the link.
            <br>
            <br>
            <a href="NewSite.html"
            target="_blank"
            title="Opens in a new tab">
                HOVER OVER ME!
            </a>
            <hr>
